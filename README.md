# Falcon-AI
**Falcon-AI** is a long-range aircraft image classifier inspired by the Azerbaijan plane crash. This AI system is designed to classify aircraft into three categories:

- **Civilian Plane**
- **Military Plane**
- **UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle)**


## 🔍 Overview

Falcon-AI is built entirely from scratch — including the **dataset**, **model**, and **architecture**. It is a powerful AI tool intended to assist military personnel and defense analysts in identifying aircraft from aerial images or long-range surveillance footage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (specify which one)
- NumPy, OpenCV, Pandas
- Custom CNN or Hybrid Model (mention architecture)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

> *Include a brief overview or a diagram if available.*  
> For example: "Falcon-AI uses a custom CNN architecture optimized for aerial imagery, followed by fully connected layers for classification."

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes approximately 60,000 and more labeled images per class . The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed ( removed noise without soomthing edges , resized efficectively , balanced classes and ensured diversity in images )
